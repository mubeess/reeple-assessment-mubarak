## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

\```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
\```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

\```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
\```

### For iOS

\```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
\```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## .env File Configuration

To make API requests, ReepleCurrency relies on an `.env` file where you'll need to set up two environment variables: `API_URL` and `API_KEY`.

- **API_URL:** This should be set to `https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6`.
- **API_KEY:** You can obtain your API key from the [ExchangeRate API dashboard](https://app.exchangerate-api.com/dashboard).

Make sure your `.env` file is located in the root of your project and follows this format:

\```
API_URL=https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
\```
